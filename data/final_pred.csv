Since I bought a 4K 42"" LED TV, I just wanted to go in for Tata Sky 4K UHD STB to have the best viewing pleasure.

",Positive
173,"

  Here is are the pros and cons of this product...Cons.1.Installation was done quickly but HD channels kept going off every 5 minutes without rain or clouds. I had to pay another man to set it properly.2. Any metal part of the STB is live and gives a nasty shock.3. Every time you press any button on the remote a small irritating square ad pops up4. There are many, many shopping channels and if you try to surf the channels these channels are cleverly hidden in between and every two or three clicks of the remote a shopping channel pops up.5. First month I enjoyed many HD channels, next month after recharging for same 280/- all HD and English channels disappeared.6. When I tried to calculate how much for the HD and missing Channels by going on the website, it came to 730/-7. There is a USB port for a 16GB pendrive but you have to pay 30/- extra per month to enable that.Pros1. Box is nice and stylish2. One can get a free new hairstyle simply by touching the metal parts of the box3. Good quality wire was used.Thinking of disconnecting and using another service.Other Satellite boxes are better especially TATA

",Positive
174,"

  One month free package is not same as shown in advertisement.They are cheating by offering lower grade package which has very few channels.Installation is OK. But you will feel cheated as they wont keep promise.

",Positive
175,"

  Now after using for 20 months I am writing this review. It's remote stopped working after 1 year and original remote costs 360 rupees. Videocon d2h service is very costly. If u have relocated and have brought ur antenna with you, the engineer will charge 450 rupees just to reinstall antenna. I don't recommend this.

",Positive
176,"

  Picture quality is good. Remote is not a RF remote, its just an IR remote. As per service person RF remotes are discontinued.But in d2h web displaying as India's first RF remote.  Bluetooth interface thru smart phone is pethetic. Audio streaming thru bluetooth is below average. Play - Pause features work only with pendrive. Recorded programmes can be played only in stb.Two stars are only for Amazon's sellar, who provided the item for less price than d2h. Even d2h CC is not aware of this & Service person couldn't believe it.

",Positive
177,"

  Over all good quality and package one month  but Hdmi cable not provided and RF remote not provided... so Rs 1449 pakage ptomise Rf remot and hdmi cable provide but not provide.. qulity... picture and one month pakage and fitting free provide but Rf remote and hdmi cable not provide

",Positive
178,"

  The antina/dish supplied with the d2h set top box is dish tv antena, I don't like that. The set top box and remote are new model, not that one shown in the picture. The new model remote and software are not comfert, many features available in the previous one are not in the new one. eg, account details not showing name, customer Id etc of the customer. The reason for this purchase is I have a better experience with the model shown in the picture. I am disappointing with the new model

",Positive
179,"

  customer service is very very poor I pay 450 for lnb repair and after one month again same problem arise. They ask again mony.Customer support is poor then Airtel.I have issue when relocation, charged 400 rs for only one side installation.IR remote consumes more battery and it's button cell so more expensive.I got problem after 1year in dish antenna they said 200rs for service charge for cheque and in Airtel they provide free service.

Best rates available in Komparify. Don't think much..go for it!

Sturdy build of Set top Box. USB Device slot is at front (as against Dish TV which has it at the back), covered by a plastic flap. Outputs include HDMI as well as regular A/V (red/white wire) output but only HDMI wire is included.
Remote is also sturdier than Videocon and Dish TV.
Packages are inexpensive when compared to other DTH providers.
More importantly, the packages contain just the channels which I need and some additional channels compared to Dish TV. This may be very subjective because everyone's choice set is so different.
Video and audio signal are both excellent.
Full HD channels are awesome.
Channel switching time ~ 2-3 seconds or so.
Some kids' channels have overlapping audio in stereo mode, one has to select left channel audio only or right channel audio only to get a distinct language audio. For example, Track 1 audio may have Hindi in Left Channel and Tamil in Right Channel, and Track 2 may have Bengali in Left Channel and Telugu in Right Channel. If it is played in stereo mode, the audio will be a garbled mix of both the languages in that one track. So choose only left or right channel.
I'm not after advanced options like USB recording or scheduled recording etc. So I haven't checked out those so far. So far so good. I will readily recommend Sun Direct DTH for those seeking a no-nonsense inexpensive DTH service.

before choosing Sun I have searched many sites and reviews and I saw very bad reviews in the net. but as of now am very happy with my decision. 
Since within one they installed and Activated the connection. I have selected Telugu World Package, but by mistake they activated Tamil World package. By contacting the sun team through the chat to change the package. They changed it within 10mins. I am very happy with this connection. Since none of the DTH provider is giving the regional channels with such a less amount. And also they are not charging any amount for the recording option(Videocon is charging 30/month).

  Best money I ever spent! I bought this for my parents who had a DishTV connection earlier. They got tired of spending money on channels they never watched. The dish antenna was already installed, so didn't need to purchase one.My father plugged in the cables and turned it on, but didn't understand what to do next. Over the phone I had him perform an auto-scan and all the channels got populated easily. It is showing a total of 128 channels right now.The picture and audio quality is quite satisfactory.

No extra port is given in this setup box. So guys if we want to simply watch free channels on TV then we can buy.

  Catvision set top box ( STB ) is very simple to use . The audio video connectors are colour coded and thus self explanatory. The leaflet supplied  in the package is adequate for  usage.  Power supply unit is standard  product. The existing dish antenna  can be connected to STB through the connector provided on it . The unit I received was pre-tuned for DD freedish channels which were available on Ch no 120 to 220 of the STB.  No tuning or adjustment of  any sort was needed for the product I received from amazon! A TV/ Radio button on the remote  can be used to choose between TV programmes of DD freedish or Akashvani radio channels . Thanks to Catvision for  such a simple as well as user friendly product and Amazon for prompt supply.

  It's build quality is very poor. Port for connection from antenna got broken during fixing. Then called another person to check whole setup and he identified that port of this new box is damaged.

The box is basic with a USB slot for plugging in a pen drive for recording live TV. However, the recording is in an encrypted format that cannot be played on any other device. the nifty feature is that the remote is universal, meaning you can teach it your TV's remote signals and use one remote for both the TV and the STB.
